Fruit Snake game created from C++

The objective of this project is to develop a classic Snake Game using C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming principles. The game should include features such as a snake that grows in length by consuming food, multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and a scoring system. The project aims to showcase advanced C++ concepts, including classes, abstract classes, encapsulation, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, and vectors.
